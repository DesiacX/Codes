# Codes
A repository of my Brawl Codes. Most are targetted towards my personal build which will be CE based.

If it is in the General-Codes folder, it should be compatable accross multiple builds.

If it is in the CE-Codes folder, it likely expects an edit that you'd only find in CE, such as a modified code menu. 

If it is in the Personal-Builds folder, its a code that either expects or is in it's entirety an edit that you'd only find in my personal build.
